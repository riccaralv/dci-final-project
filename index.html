          One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
          himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
          armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
          brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
          The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off
          any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of
          the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened
          to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human

        <p>
          A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
          these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am
          alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created
          for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so
          absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
          neglect my talents. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a
          dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small. I
          should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
          and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while
          the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun
          strikes the upper surface.

          Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
          Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they
          live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large
          language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
          supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic
          country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even
          the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
